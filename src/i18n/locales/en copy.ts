    nonexpandingtypecoatingproductionequipment:'Non-expanding type coating production equipment',
    nonexpandingtypecoatingproductionequipmentDesc: 'The core advantages of fire-retardant coatings include: 1. High fire resistance: They form a protective layer through expansion and insulation or low thermal conductivity, slowing down the spread of fire and buying time for rescue efforts. 2. Multifunctionality: They combine decorative functions (such as surface finishes) with structural protection (for steel structures and concrete). 3. Environmental friendliness and safety: Primarily composed of inorganic components, they produce less smoke and toxic gases during a fire. 4. Economical and practical: They are easy to apply, have low maintenance costs, and are suitable for a variety of substrates.',
    expandingtypecoatingproductionequipment:'Intumescent coating production equipment',
    expandingtypecoatingproductionequipmentDesc: 'Fire-retardant coatings are primarily used in the following areas: 1. Steel structures: such as high-rise buildings and industrial plants, to protect steel components and extend their fire resistance. 2. Wooden structures and combustible substrates: such as wood and fiberboard, where fire-retardant coatings are applied as a surface treatment to prevent combustion. 3. Tunnels and underground engineering: used for fire protection of concrete structures, such as subways and underground parking garages. 4. Cables and pipelines: to prevent the spread of fire, commonly found in power and chemical facilities. 5. Transportation facilities: such as fire protection for the internal structures of aircraft and ships.',
