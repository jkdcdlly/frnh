    nonexpandingtypecoatingproductionequipmentDesc: 'Core advantages of fireproof coatings include: 1. Efficient fire protection: Form a protective layer through expansion insulation or low thermal conductivity to delay the spread of fire and buy time for rescue. 2. Versatility: Combine decorative (such as finishing type) and structural protection (such as steel structure, concrete) functions. 3. Environmental safety: Mainly inorganic components, less smoke and toxic gas during fire. 4. Economical and practical: Simple construction, low maintenance cost, suitable for a variety of substrates.',
    expandingtypecoatingproductionequipment:'Intumescent Coating Production Equipment',
    expandingtypecoatingproductionequipmentDesc: 'Main application areas of fireproof coatings: 1. Steel structure buildings: such as high-rise buildings, industrial plants, etc., used to protect the fire resistance limit of steel components. 2. Wooden structures and combustible substrates: such as wood, fiberboard, etc., flame retarded by finishing type fireproof coatings. 3. Tunnels and underground projects: used for fire protection of concrete structures, such as subways and underground garages. 4. Cables and pipelines: prevent fire spread, common in power and chemical facilities. 5. Transportation facilities: such as internal structure fire protection of aircraft and ships.',
